					from a support. Similar to a pull-up bar this provides a full upper 
					body workout</p>

					<p>Chinese poles are vertical poles on which circus performers climb, 
					slide down and hold poses.  The poles are sometimes coated in rubber 
					to improve grip.  Chinese pole provides a full body workout with 
					emphasis on the shoulders and back.</p>

					  overall muscle control and balance</p>

					remember from P.E class.  Similar to the Chinese pole, it provides a 
					full body workout.</p>
