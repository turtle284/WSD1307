					<p>It is very important to remember that there is risk of injury when performing any kind of exercise.
					Many of these exercises are more dangerous than most.  It is highly recommended that you
					practice safely using mats and harnesses when appropriate.  It is also recommended that 
					beginners perform the movements under the supervision of an experienced professional or trainer.
					These exercises offer a great alternative to going to the gym.</p>
